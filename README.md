Timelock is a secure, time-locked file sharing application built with Rust. It allows users to encrypt files and share them with recipients who can only decrypt them after a specified future date.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as a Rust workspace containing the following crates:

* `client`: Contains the CLI for users to encrypt, send, and receive time-locked files.
* `server`: Implements the backend server responsible for storing and managing the encrypted files and associated metadata.
* `shared`: Houses common code and data structures used by both the client and the server.
